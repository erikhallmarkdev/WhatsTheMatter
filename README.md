# What's the Matter?
Ludum Dare 38

What's the matter is a simple game of making elements, you can create elements higher on the periodic table with two simple methods.

Made in Unity 5.6.0f3 Personal.

1. Capture electrons by moving a nucleus near it

2. Fuse elements together by colliding one element into another.

**There's some really messy code here, I'm sorry for that.**
